### Description

This is a front end project using React done while studying at Northcoders! It sets up a basic reviews website utilizing the database created in my previous portfolio back end project.

### Installation process:

1. Clone
2. Install Dependencies
3. Run local server
4. ??? Profit

### Clone

On the repo main page near the top there is a bright green 'Code' button, click it. You then need to copy the URL displayed. In your terminal (command line), navigate to the folder where you wish to clone the project to. Then run the command 'git clone PROJECT_URL' e.g. 'git clone https://github.com/Edgily/fe-edgey-games'. This will install everything into an 'fe-edgey-games' folder.

### Install Dependencies

This project was made with (and may depend on):

- node v17.1.0

Navigate into the newly created 'edgey-games' folder in your terminal. In the terminal, run the command 'npm i' which will install all other dependencies.

### Run Local Server

Simply run the 'npm start' command to start a local development server so that you can see the project in full glory!

### ??? Profit

Thanks for checking out my project! Now you can mess around with the site to your hearts content!
